#Life time User Engaging App   
Trait and future of this application   

##An Interesting Story    
#####I want to share a Story with you. Its pretty interesting. You may love this      
Before 1962 Bata shoe company send some delegate to Bangladesh. Whether Bangladesh has market for shoe or sandal. So that, they can open branch, make a factory. When Bata people came to Bangladesh they discover people are not using sandal or shoe. Almost people are walking barefoot. So they find out probability of getting success for their company is pretty low. So they left Bangladesh. Few months later they send another delegate team. They saw same thing with different perspective. They told to their company we are not leaving Bangladesh. Send more people as early as possible to build factory and open branch in here. This is because most of the people don't have sandal and shoe here. Its huge market. Now it's 2017. Now Bata is the leading shoe and sandal company in Bangladesh. Do you know Bangladesh has world largest Bata showrooms(1,910 sqm, 65k customers in one month). So thinking in different perspective is a big thing to make a bigger, biggest decision.    

##From user perspective    
So I made a Application. Made this application for student/user, to learn anything organize and efficient way, manage their study material for future. Some traits are following     

* Student / User can learn anything organize and efficient way by using this application.
* Student can labeling content by their subject name > chapter name. so in future they can find their content/lesson easily. Which will be huge time saver. 
* People can write book here. Which eventually make him/her a author. Years later we may integrate premium subscribing for reading private book. From where user could earn money. 
* application will be student/user self reference book for their entire life 
* it will help student to repeat their learned stuff quicker. So that small student will be average. average student will be genius. Genius people will be superb (Basic rule of repetition, to be super learner )
* Student / User can able to find their content very easily through time line search. It could be time travel to finding their study material. 
* User will make lot of content which will contribute to other people learning. which kind of motivating for lot of user. 
* Since they can make their post protected and private. it will maintain their privacy.
* it will be best companion tool for a student.
* it will be best tool for a reader. Hence he/she will get lot of summaries of specific things. 
* Reader who do analysis kind of thing it will best web application for them. 
* people will get gist of lot of books with out purchasing or reading whole book. So it will save peoples money and time. I am personally like to read gist of book instead  of reading whole book. Because we are busy, sometime lazy or We don't have time
* user can communicate with each other like other social media platform. 
* people can discuss about content through comments
* people can ask question.

##From company perspective   
I made this application based on single rule -> If you want to be millionaire, you have to make something which can help million people. And i strongly believe it will do. Whenever anything comes to company I have to think businessFirst way.    
* Student will get benefit from this application from the very first day of uses of this application. if anyone use this application for month he or she will be fan of this application. since there are no alternative of this application. It will make people life easier and organize. And we will get lifetime user. In company valuation "Active user" play vital role.
* By making another social network like facebook, no one can be like Mark Zuckerberg. This is because Man who comes first, will be president in corresponding sector. The application i made currently I haven't seen such kind of platform which can contribute in people life that way. So I am excited. I am expected. IB will be president.
* when you have million traffic in your site you can do infinite things to monetize. Mainly easier way to digital advertising. In 2021, only USA will expense one billion $ in digital advertising. People are not watching advertisement on tv. People have remote on their hand. Dubur company also know that. 
* You will find out rich website Rich by "million people content" not by in house content. million people will store their content. And all content organic. So there will be lot of content/data in application. If you have lot of data(people data) you can monetize better. Earlier Economy was based on agriculture then industrialized. Now we live in knowledge(data) based Economy.
* Latest is greatest. But I didn't use React despite latest trend. Hence its less Search Engine(SEO) friendly. I made this application with laravel framework and vue js frontend framework. Which also I learned from You. I feel like laravel is amazing framework for building bigger scalable application. All page will be server side rendering. Which is search engine firendly. So we can expect huge organic traffic. 
* The relation with user is reciprocal. User will getting benefit by storing their data/content organize way. people will use this for their need. we will get lot of content eventually. which will turn into organic traffic.
* we help people to write book by giving them a sophisticated platform. I believe when people start writing book it will be bigger than big publication company like Oreily media, packt. safari books.
* we may be acquired by tech giant like google, facebook in future if things done expected.
* We can advertise our own products like adaptive engine
* We can integrate premium subscribing option for reading protected book. Or we may integrate e-commerce book store. We can do infinite things when we have user.
* People may stop using facebook for while because they may find out social minimization could be good for them for time being, people may stop using twitter, linkedin, quora by thinking same. Me myself, when did i login last time in facebook and twitter I forget. I believe when it comes to this app people won't think that way. I believe people will use this app day to day basis. After years of using this platform, people even never switch to same platform(if any app rise, which will provide same service to the user). This is because switching cost for user will be huge. You know more switching cost also good for company. This is because when it comes to company valuation "switching cost" play vital role<

we have people, Brilliant people, Genius people, Super People, Meritorious people. Ranked people in IB. So we have endless possibility if we believe, if we start.   
I am excited. I am expecting.

##From social perspective   
App will help student to organize their lesson. So we are contributing in education. We are giving student best education tool. When student start using this application I believe it will be super brand few Years later.   
When we have million of user we can do lot of social campaign. we can spread the message of MTWW to the whole world. We can spread mtww to whole world.   
when we grow bigger we have to have huge number employee. So lot of employment.   
          
##What can be done now from my perspective    

I believe its a million $ idea. One man can't maintain this. We have to scale up this application this way  we can accommodate million of people. currently i am using mysql as Database. which can be pretty good for retrieving and mutating data from million sql row. which may not effect in performance when row is less than 5 million. But data will grow exponentially.  so we have to go with big data architecture like hadoop, hive, cassandra. Apache cassandra could be good choice to implement with laravel. Or we can use mysql along with memcached or redis as a caching layer in front of MySQL. Redis is good option for laravel    
I integrate most of feature but lot of things we can improve. Specially design. We have best design team.  have to see all the vulnerability. We have in house cyber security people. We need make it internalization(website in different language) We have best engineer. They can make this app great. The application is kind of ready for deployment. I also made API for making android and ios application. But whenever I visualize the future data flow i think my app as prototype app which can be extended to actual deployment app. we have lot of people associated with ib. we can start using this application by our people. so that we can make things better. if 500 people start using this app at  the end of the year you will see the app became rich. Since lot of content!. You can expect lot of organic traffic. I believe in progressive overload   
We do lot of campaign. The impact of these campaign on IB is temporary.I mean not for life time engaging. Campaign for this app, will be life time engaging. Hence this is life time engaging application. Which can be done along with other campaign. But it would be good to keep it secret till final deployment.   

#conclusion   
Facebook twitter quora instagram linkedIn they will survive century after century. Because those application is "life time user engage" application. Those app makes people life easier. They have huge content.   
To make IB globally famous we need to make a platform where people from all around the world engage with us by using our product. By purchasing our service.  I think this is missing piece of IB. which can engage million people with IB for life time.  Because It's people self reference book. People own wikitionary. It will be "life time user engage" app   
Objective of this webpage is to give you overall picture about trait and future of this application. I believe i did, through state above. I  believe you people also see the bigger picture like mine.<   
This is the first baby of mine. I am a business graduate. So it requires touch of real engineer. It requires touch of "greatness of IB", to be adult. Super adult. Super brand. Which eventually make this app billion  dollar application. if you people believe.   
A little perspective, Andra and Telegana is kind of "land of engineers". I feel like here people are very sincere by default(birth). If those people get such kind of platform they will love this. They will go for it. Because that will change the way they learning    
I believe  our SVK sir think 10 step clearly ahead than general people. I strongly believe things fall into place. I believe sir will love this.   
 Trello is simply multi tenant  Todo app. Before Trello there were lot of todo app.  After Trello there are lot of todo app. But no one compete Trello. This is because its gives user most sophisticated platform to organize todos. They understood what user need. It has very good utilization for their user. So my approach is, in order to understand and invest on idea I should build a prototype (in my case real) app so that you people can understand and visualize the true potential of this idea, of this application. I believe you people will love that.    
I love IB. I feel like you people are my guardian.   
When I about to leaving (january) India I was sad. By hearing my status from Vamsi bro, You called me and told me "The relation with IB is for life time". This sentence was most convincing in my life. That day was happiest day in my life. I love to be here. So I generate a Idea for IB, made a app for IB. This app will be "Life time user engage app". I believe million of people will engage with IB through this app. Million of people will know this company through this app   
I feel like, most of the people are very wise in IB, like Ranjith Bro. You people are every way perfect. I wanted to stay longer in Bangladesh not only for exam but also study lot of book. Hence I didn't study much before. I believe If I study lot of book I will be wise like you people. I came to BD but I didn't study. Rather try to generate Idea, Make a structure of my Idea, Implement my idea. I feel like this idea can help million of people(including me) to be sincere, wise, engaged and super learner. Eventually company will make million $.   
Ignore my casual English.   
It's definitely will be "life time user engaging App"
