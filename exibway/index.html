          <p>I want to share a Story with you. Its pretty interesting. You may love this.</p>
          <p>Before 1962 Bata shoe company sent some delegate to Bangladesh. Whether Bangladesh has market for shoe or sandal. So that, they can open branch, make a factory. When Bata people came to Bangladesh they discover people are not using sandal or shoe. Almost people are walking barefoot. So they find out probability of getting success for their company is pretty low. So they left Bangladesh. Few months later they send another delegate team. They saw same thing with different perspective. They told to their company we are not leaving Bangladesh. Send more people as early as possible to build factory and open branch in here. This is because, most of the people walking barefoot, they don't have sandals and shoes here. Its huge market. Now it's 2017. Now Bata is the leading shoe and sandal company in Bangladesh. Do you know Bangladesh has world <a href="http://world.bata.com/news/2013/largest-bata-shoe-store-world-serves-65000-customers-one-month/" target="_blank" class="is-link">largest Bata showrooms</a> (1,910 sqm, serving 65k customers in one month). So thinking in different perspective is a big thing to make a bigger, biggest decision.</p>

            <p>So I made a Application. Prototype Application. Made this application for student/user, to learn anything organize and efficient way, manage their study material for future. Some traits are following :</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Student / User can learn anything organize and efficient way by using this application.</li>
              <li>Student can labeling content by their subject name > chapter name. so in future they can find their content/lesson easily. Which will be huge time saver. </li>
              <li>People can write book here. Which eventually make him/her a author. Years later we may integrate premium subscribing for reading private book. From where user could earn money. </li>
              <li>Application will be student/user self reference book for their entire life. </li>
              <li>It will help student to repeat their learned stuff quicker. So that small student will be average. average student will be genius. Genius people will be superb (Basic rule of repetition, to be super learner ).</li>
              <li>Student / User can able to find their content very easily through time line search. It could be time travel to finding their study material. </li>
              <li>Student can make their assignments by help of this application.</li>
              <li>User will make lot of content which will contribute to other people learning. which kind of motivating for lot of user. </li>
              <li>Since they can make their post protected and private. it will maintain their privacy.</li>
              <li>It will be the best companion tool for a student.</li>
              <li class="hidden">It will be best tool for a reader. Hence he/she will get lot of summaries of specific things. </li>
              <li class="hidden">Reader who do analysis kind of thing, it will best web application for them. </li>
              <li>People will get gist of lot of books, with out purchasing or reading whole book. So it will save peoples money and time. I am personally like to read gist of book instead  of reading whole book. Because we are busy, sometime lazy or We don't have time.</li>
              <li>User can communicate with each other like other social media platform. </li>
              <li>People can participate in discussion.</li>
              <li>People can ask question.</li>

            <p>I made this application based on single rule -> If you want to be millionaire, you have to make something which can help million people. And I strongly believe it will do. Whenever anything comes to company I have to think businessFirst way. </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Student will get benefit from this application, from the very first day of uses of this application. if anyone use this application for few months he or she will be fan of this application. since there are no alternative of this application. It will make people life easier and organize. And we will get lifetime user. In company valuation "Active user" play vital role.</li>
              <li>By making another social network like facebook, no one can be like Mark Zuckerberg. This is because Man who comes first, will be president in corresponding sector. The application i made currently I haven't seen such kind of platform which can contribute in people life that way. So I am excited. I am expected. IB will be president.</li>
              <li>when you have million traffic in your site you can do infinite things to monetize. Mainly easier way to advertising. In 2021, only USA will have <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-us-digital-media-ad-revenue-report-the-path-to-100-billion-in-annual-revenue-by-2021-2016-8" target="_blank" class="is-link">100 billion $</a> in DIGITAL MEDIA AD. More than 70% advertising will be social/Web advertisement by this year. People are not watching advertisement on tv. People have remote on their hand. Dubur company also know that. </li>
              <li>You will find out rich website Rich by "million people content" not by in house content. million people will store their content. And all content organic. So there will be lot of content/data in application. If you have lot of data(people data) you can monetize better. Earlier Economy was based on agriculture then industrialized. Now we moved from an industrial economy to a knowledge economy. Where data is our asset.</li>
              <li>Latest is greatest. But I didn't use React despite latest trend. Hence its less Search Engine(SEO) friendly. I made this application with laravel framework and vue js frontend framework. Which also I learned from You. I feel like laravel is amazing framework for building application. And its database agnostic. All page will be server side rendering. Which is search engine friendly. So we can expect huge organic traffic. We might change stack if necessary. I heard asp.net and java EE best choice for big scalable application. </li>
              <li>The relation with user is reciprocal. User will getting benefit by storing their data/content organize way. people will use this for their need. we will get lot of content eventually. which will turn into organic traffic.</li>
              <li>we help people to write book by giving them a sophisticated platform. I believe when people start writing book it will be bigger than big publication company like Oreily media, packt. safari books. We can make it very big lean publication platform.</li>
              <li>we may be acquired by tech giant like google, facebook in future if things done expected.</li>
              <li>We can advertise our own products like adaptive engine.</li>
              <li>We can integrate premium subscribing option for reading protected book. Or we may integrate e-commerce book store. We can do infinite things when we have user.</li>
              <li>People may stop using facebook for while because they may find out social minimization could be good for them for time being, people may stop using twitter, linkedin by thinking same. Me myself, when did i login last time in facebook and twitter I forget. I believe when it comes to this app people won't think that way. I believe people will use this app day to day basis. After years of using this platform, people even never switch to same platform(if any one mimic our idea/app and release). This is because switching cost for user will be huge. You know more switching cost also good for company. This is because when it comes to company valuation "switching cost" play vital role.</li> 
              <li>When we have million of user we can make our other application popular, we can make our other application rich through this application.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>we have people, Brilliant people, Genius people, Super People, Meritorious people. Ranked people in IB. Possibility is Endless if we believe, if we start.</p>
            <p>I am excited. I am expecting.</p>

              <li>App will help student to organize their lesson. So we are contributing in education. We are giving student best education tool. When student start using this application I believe it will be super brand few Years later.</li>
              <li>This app will help people to be more organize. Eventually people will be more productive.</li>
              <li>This app will be bridge between different educational institute. Student will get lesson from different university. e.g IIT student share content with IIIT student.</li>
              <li>When we will have million of user we can do lot of social campaign. we can spread the message of MTWW (creating and spreading harmony) to the whole world. We can spread "Make the world wonderful" to whole world.</li>
              <li>People can make own community through this Application. Based on same city, same college, same university. It might help people connect with their alumni.</li>
              <li>When we grow bigger we have to have huge number employee. So lot of employment.</li>
              <li>We can't make the world paperless. However we will be able to contribute in go green, go paperless commitment a lot.</li>
              <li>I strongly believe we can make this App biggest social Blogging platform and I haven't seen such platform rise yet. So that we can connect whole world very resourceful way.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I made this application generosity in mind and I strongly believe it will contribute in mankind with greater extent.</p>

            <p>I believe its a million $ idea. We have to scale up this application this way  we can accommodate million of people. Currently I am using sql(mysql) database. which can be pretty good for retrieving and mutating data from million sql row. which may not effect in performance when row is less than million. But data will grow exponentially.  so we have to go with big data architecture like hadoop, hive, cassandra. Apache cassandra could be good choice. Currently facebook using cassandra. Or we can use sql database along with memcached as a caching layer in front of sql database (which also won't be good decision). We might use python django. Since we already have very  strong python dev team. I heard facebook suffering with php stack from the very beginning so they made their very own compiler HHVM, hack language. Hence they can’t migrate from php due to huge code base.</p>
            <p>I integrate some of the features but lot of things we can improve. Specially design. We have best design team. JK bro is amazing. I believe our team will be able to give user best UX (like Dropbox). Have to see all the vulnerability. We have in house cyber security people. We need make it internalization(website in different language) We have best engineer. They can make this app great. The application is kind of ready for deployment. But whenever I visualize the future data flow, I think my app as prototype app which can be extended to actual deployment app. we have lot of people associated with ib. we can start using this application by our people. So that, <b>rather than assumption we can examine user experience</b>. So that we can make things better. If 200 people start using this app, at  the end of the year you will see the app became rich. Since lot of content!. You can expect lot of organic traffic. I believe in progressive overload.</p>
            <p>We do lot of campaign. The impact of these campaign on IB is not for life time. Campaign for this app, will be life time engaging. Hence this is life time user engaging application. Which can be done along with other campaign. But it would be good to keep it secret till final deployment. This is because this idea implementation is not hard like google search algorithm. Its easier for Any company to make app based upon this idea. If any company made their move before us, <b>we can’t be first any longer</b>.</p>

            <p>For a company <b>growth is easy to measure but durability isn't</b>. In case of a successful or going to be successful "life time user engage" app you can measure durability. You can predict certain traffic every month. You can predict company stability. Facebook twitter quora instagram linkedIn they will survive century after century. Because those application is "life time user engage" application. Those app makes people life easier. They have huge content.</p>
            <p>To make IB globally famous we need to make a platform where people from all around the world engage with us by using our product. By purchasing our service. I feel like, IB need a "life time user engage" application desperately. So that IB will be stable century after century. I think this is missing piece of IB. which can engage million people with IB for life time.  Because It's people self reference book. People own wiktionary. Personal wikipedia which has utilization to their entire life. It will be "life time user engage" app.</p>
            <p>You will find out most of the tech giant doing business internationally without being physically international. Facebook monetize huge from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal through localized advertisement but they don't have any office there. So they get rid of lot things like taxation, domestic rule and regulation, maintenance. You know Coca-Cola quit India in 1973, after the government demanded that they reveal their secret recipe and transfer other technical information to local management. Though they re-enter india <a href="http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/20-years-later-a-look-back-at-cokes-dramatic-1993-return-to-india" target="_blank" class="is-link">20 years later</a> . Uber started their service in Bangladesh few months ago. I thought i will use Uber when I will go to Dhaka. But within One week Bangladesh government <a href="http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/dhaka/2016/11/25/brta-uber-illegal-bangladesh/" target="_blank" class="is-link">ban Uber</a>. So there are lot of complexity when comes to international business. So I believe if we make a "life time user engage" Application we can do business internationally without being international. We can do business globally. We will recognize globally.</p>
            <p>Objective of this webpage is to give you overall picture about trait and future of this application. I believe i did, through state above. I  believe you people also see the bigger picture like mine.</p> 
            <p>This is the first baby of mine. I am a business graduate. So it requires touch of real engineer. It requires touch of "greatness of IB", to be adult. Super adult. Super brand. Which eventually make this app billion  dollar application. if you people believe.</p>
            <p>A little perspective, Andra and Telegana is kind of "land of engineers". I feel like here people are very sincere by default(birth). If those people get such kind of platform they will love this. They will go for it. Because that will change the way they learning. </p>

            <p>I believe  our SVK sir think 10 step clearly ahead than general people. I feel like Sir is Indian Peter Thiel. Peter Thiel is early investor of very successful company like Paypal(co founder), Facebook. One of the interesting thing is, he was Libertarian in his whole life. But in 2016 election he became Republican. And Republican won the election. He is very good @ visualization, very good @ prediction. He is ranked chess player. He thinks 10 step clearly ahead than general people. Which makes his every decision profitable. I heard sir also very good chess player. I strongly believe things fall into place. I believe sir will love this. When I first heard our startup, incubation program. I didn't understand How those things work and how those thinks help IB. When I came to know android founder Andy Rubin also doing same business  then I understand sir has very big vision which I can't perceive now.</p>

          <p>Wordpress founder Matt Mullenweg made billion $ company through wordpress cms. Before wordpress there are CMS like drupal was in market. Initial release of Wordpress was so simple that I believe I can make such application(initial release) with in 6 months. However wordpress became very popular. Lot of people start using wordpress because of its simplicity, great utilization, less complexity. People always want great utilization with less complexity. He made billion $ company(Automattic) because he has very good business model along with his wordpress. I believe the app I made, It has less complexity with great utilization. This utilization, user will get their life time. </p>

            <p> Trello is a amazing multi tenant Todo app. Before Trello there were lot of todo app.  After Trello there are lot of todo app. But no one compete Trello. It became one of the best project management application. This is because its gives user most sophisticated platform to organize tasks, collaborate todos with team. They understood what user need. It has very good utilization for their user. This year(2017) Atlassian Acquires Trello For $425 Million. So my approach is, in order to understand and invest on idea I should build a prototype app so that you people can understand and visualize the true potential of this idea, of this application. I believe you people will love that. Another thing I heard, when you have great idea you should skip the brainstorming and go right from eureka to execution. So I did execute some level to understand better. Brainstorming before execution procrastinate to start execution. But it can be done along with execution. </p>

            <p>I love IB. I feel like you people are my guardian. If i didn't come to India I might do job in bank or any other business sector. Those job might be give me early stability but not happiness. But here I am surrounded by right people. Positive people. Best people. Which is very promising for my future. You gave me very good platform to work.</p>

            <p>When I about to leaving (january) India I was sad. By hearing my status from Vamsi bro, You called me and told me "The relation with IB is for life time". This sentence was most convincing in my life. That day was one of my best day in my life. I love to be here. One day you told me I am in core team. I don't know what function core team will do but this word made happy to me. So I generate an Idea for IB, made a app for IB. This app will be "Life time user engage app". I believe million of people will engage with IB for life time through this app. Million of people will know this company through this idea.</p>

            <p>I feel like, most of the people are very wise in IB, like Ranjith Bro, like Neerad sir, like Avinash Dara, like You. You people are every way perfect. I wanted to stay longer in Bangladesh not only for exam but also study some book. Hence I didn't study much before. I feel like I need to read book. I came to BD but I didn't study. Rather, try to generate Idea, Make a structure of my Idea, Implement my idea. I feel like this idea can help million of people(including me) to be sincere, wise, engaged and super learner. Eventually company will make billion $. I believe, this app will bring prosperity in IB. This app make IB very stable, so that IB will survive century after century, like other "life time user engage" application.</p>

            <p>We have lot of connection with different university, premium university, university student. And this is golden time to connect those people with IB, for life time, reciprocal way. Golden time to make a glossary like IBian. </p>
            <p>I strongly believe IB has distinctive capability to make a "life time user engaging App" very successful.</p>

            <p>We can release an Artificial intelligence Device (AI) for our app, like amazon echo(Alexa), Google Home, facebook jarvis some years later. Which will help user to read his life time content by dictation. User will get and listen any necessary content in second (we make user own content cached inside AI). I have seen Bisnu bro working on machine learning. Sir we have brilliant people here. Its the golden time to start something which can make IB stable to survive century after  century. It's billion people country. I believe IB can make this app a giant app like fb, twitter, linkedin.</p>
            <p>Linkedin has about half billion user. They have endless option to monetize. They already have premium subscribing option.  In 2015, LinkedIn Acquired lynda. Added new subdomain  <a href="https://learning.linkedin.com" target="_blank" class="is-link">https://learning.linkedin.com (lynda)</a>. Its monthly subscribing free $25 ~ $37.5. Which is kind of huge for one month. However they have 4+ million users. We may integrate some learning site inside this app in future. When we have million of user, we have endless possibility. This subdomain itself is 1.5 billion dollar company. Sir this is the huge Eye-opener for me. I worked with adaptive engine. I feel like if we make a popular "life time user engage" app, we can make our AE, EE popular through this. <b>Any membership oriented business is king.</b> You can predict your revenue.</p>
            <p>We can integrate game platform inside this application in future. Game related with education, learning, user engaging.</p>
            <p>Facebook working on brain in computer interface. In last F8 conference they introduced silent speech communication (dev mode) by through people can write up to 100 words in one minute. which is 5x speed than mobile typing. Might be we can integrate their technology in our app in future when those technology become available. So that people can write content easily, store content easily. If we give user maximum utilization with maximum comfort they will be more engage with our app. more importantly it will save peoples time. </p>
            <p>Since most of the user will be student so We can integrate a interactive job board. Old alumni can post job. Company can post job. When we have million of user we can expect, it will be very big job portal. I believe recruiter will also get expected employee. When recruiter will go through user profile they can measure how efficient employee will be. How organize employee will be. I believe student will also get expected job. Most importantly it will help people to get job globally since we won't be limited in India. Since it will be community driven I can expect one day it will be one of the largest job portal if things done expected. Sir we can contribute to society in lot of ways. Stack Overflow has about 4+ million registered users. They have a job portal. Which help developer getting job worldwide. Though stack overflow job portal kind of niche job portal but in our case it will be solid job portal. Hence user will be from different types of domain. I believe a job portal can make a company billion  $ dollar company.</p>
            <p>The way user will grow in this platform I believe user will have lot of trust on IB. When we have million of people we can make our very own Crypto Currency based on Blockchain. I believe once we make our very own crypto currency we can change whole Indian transaction and business. We can make smart contact agency which will help govt and general people. People can pay tax, donate money, keep record their data. This could be a future monopolistic business plan.</p>
            <p>I know the capability of IB. IB can make it real. I believe there are no company in the world have cumulative positive energy like IB. I believe, if we start a "life time user engage" app, we definitely will be very successful, stable company, to survive century after century. Most importantly we will have million of active user.  </p>

            <p>Sir please don't be irritate by so many example. sometimes you might feel some example is not co-related with my idea. However thing is I evaluate my idea comparing with other idea, successful idea, successful app. If you think future of this application you definitely get co-relation. I think, future of app, future features of app, how to monetize from app by comparing other app, other idea. Eventually I believe this idea billion $ idea. Any great idea valuation is 0, until it implements(20% done I believe - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" class="is-link" target="_blank">MVP</a> ) AND until it reach to end-user.</p>
            
            <p>I believe if IB start a "life time user engage" application, some years later we will see SVK sir on "Forbes real time list". This is because IB can go with very good business model and here lot of genius people like you, Neerad sir who can make those business model very successful.</p>
            <p>
              After a hotel management course I did intern in a hotel few months. One day my executive chef told me If anyone want to be millionaire he/she should do one business out of 3 business
              <ul>
                <li>Drug -> which is illegal</li>
                <li>Weapon -> which is very illegal</li>
                <li>Hospitality Industry (Hotel, Restaurant, Hospital) -> which is very legal and very lavish business. Bill Gates is majority owners of "Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts". I wish one day IB will have their own hotel. IB will host lemons meet in own banquet hall. All parents can stay IB's hotel before parents meet. Sir one funny thing is Microsoft people are not allowed to stay at the Four Seasons when traveling on business, even if that business is on behalf of the Four Seasons. They must choose a lower-cost, less luxurious hotel. Microsoft try to save their money by practicing frugality, minimalism. Might be IB will be interest on making chain hospital like Apollo instead or alongside Hotel. Sir when we have million of user we can plan for lot of things.</li>
              </ul>
              I believe a successful "Life time user engage" Application can make a company billion $ company. Last year facebook revenue was 27,638 million(27.6 billion). If those company make billion we certainly will be able to make million in near future and we will have million of active user. Now we live in knowledge based economy. Where data is our asset. And this app will generate data with exponential rate.
            </p>
            <p>My grandfather is a religious person. I used to listen lot of religious story from him. One of the story is - In a village there were gang of 5 dacoit lived. They were very notorious for their dacoity activities. Villagers hate them. In the same village there was a saint. Who used to wake up @ 4am and roaming around whole village with some musical instrument and recite "Hare Krsihna Hare Krishna Krishna krishna Hare Hare...". Villagers love him and give him grocery and commodity stuff. Those 5 dacoit was feel envy about that. So they planned to make there group "gang of 6" by adding that priest. So they go to priest and ask him, If you not join in our gang we will kill you. Priest agreed to join their gang with a condition. Condition was before joining your gang you have to do thing what I am doing now for a week. 5 dacoit agreed. So all dacoit shaved their head with keeping a little ponytail. Very next day they wake up @4am, roam around villages with musical instrument and recite that religious line with saint. Week later every dacoit find out the grocery and commodity stuff they got in week, it generally take them more than a month to get. They realize its better to be a saint instead dacoit. So they leave dacoity forever. Initially they were greedy to be saint but that daily ritual habit one day make them generous. What is the correlation this story with this idea? I believe once people used to live with good life, organized life people try to stick with that. I believe This app will make people life organized. Once people get the taste of organized life people will stick with that. People will use this platform in their whole life.</p>
            <p>Sir this app will help student to organize their life. I believe this app will play crucial role in million students life. When we will reach million our adaptability will be huge in domestic and internationally. We can make chain school, college. We can found private University like BITS. Sir when we have million of user we will have endless possibility. However founding educational institute will be best choice since we will have greater adaptability in this area since primarily we will be contributing in education sector through our app. Purchasing a IPL team will be bad idea. Making a movie will be good idea. It will stay years after years.</p>
            <p>Elon Musk is smartest guy in the world. He is founder of Tesla, SpaceX, PayPal, SolarCity, OpenAI, TBC, Zip2,  Neuralink, Hyperloop and The Boring Company. He is changing the world by creating better products for the people. I feel like he is a super human being. Despite that he is not much popular like Mark Zuckerberg. This is because Mark Zuckerberg concentrate on "life time user engage" application. Facebook acquired Instagram(600 million user), WhatsApp which is using billion people everyday. So Billion people know Mark. And I believe million people will know IB, million people will know SVK sir, Million people will connect with IB when we start a "life time user engage" App. And this app will help million people in their entire life.</p>
            <p>We are working on trendy technology like VR. When we release a product we can reach very large number of potential audience in matter of seconds. Valuation of these business unit will be so high. Lot of people will be interested in investing in our new products. <b>We can accomplish 10 years plan with in 6 months!!</b></p>
            <p>Sir I love IB.</p>
            <p>When I visualize far future I feel like we will compete with tech giant like fb, twitter, google through this app. I feel like IB can make it first Indian giant "life time user engage" application. Indian advertising industry is huge. So we have endless possibility. Other tech giant planning their product mix considering Indian market. Its a billion people country and IB is pure Indian company. So We have endless possibility. Possibility to make glossary like IBian.</p> 
            <p>I strongly believe a student who will use this platform from his class 8 or 9 he/she will deserve Standford education. I believe 10 ~ 15 years later 9 out of 10 Standford student used to use our platform. I believe big big Enterprise, corporate never think about such kind platform. This is the reason we will be president in community dependent business. I believe future google CEO might be use this platform from his/her childhood.</p>
            <p>In future you will see school and college student will upload homework in this platform and message to his/her class teacher. It could be very greener approach to make the world paperless(partially). University student write journal in this platform and share his journal to whole world. Due to excessive convenience Student will write book here. I believe SVK sir may write his first book in this platform.</p>
            <p>Before releasing App certainly we will go through lot of iteration. I believe you people will add lot of new features on top of this Idea. We may add new feature frequently which make user more engage with this application, we may subtract feature from this app. If you look to other "life time user engage" application you will find out they are adding lot of new feature frequently to make user more engage. This app will be data centric. I believe we will have less traffic Bounce rate than other app.</p>
            <p>Sir I always try to listen to my heart and I love Virat kohli.</p>
            <p>I feel like, this idea came from my heart. People may laughing about me if people see this. Hence its serious out of the box thinking. I didn't sleep night after night by thinking "The Thinking". I empathize what actually user need to make a "life time user engage" application. However I strongly believe, for IB everything I dream about, can be achievable easily. Sometimes challenge regarding this app appear daunting to me, then I realize in every business there are lot of challenge. But here challenge for big thing, very big thing, massive thing and the amount of challenge more or less same. We are going to help million of people by overcoming those challenges. I believe we will have best marketing strategy, best business strategy to over come all those challenges.  Since we are having best people here.  Since we will be first in this area so there won't be any competition. We will do goal in empty field without confronting  opponents. Sounds like monopoly. Monopolies are good, for both business and society. This actually good for everyone.  Google, Microsoft and Facebook pretty much a monopoly. Peter Thiel emphasis about that in his zero to one book. And I strongly believe we will be the one. </p>
            <p>I wanted to inform you about this app years later, after makes it juvenile by myself. But one thing is, if you find out it won't add value to company I can stop now. Other things are, I go through lot of server side jargon like  Load balancing, NGINX, forge, docker, envoyer, AWS, Elastic Beanstalk, EC2. Lot of things blow over my head when comes to integrate and integrating is time taking for me. Plus The tech stack(php-laravel, vue) I am using currently for this app have to switch stack totally. So I feel like, it will be better to work with real engineer. Another thing I was scared <b> if someone's get this idea and already made their move before us, we can’t be first any longer. Any idea which is technology based, should need to move fast or it will be too late.</b> Sir I believe, if we up and running this app for 2 years, User will increase geometrically not arithmetically. Parents will ask their child to use this app in future. people will use this application in their entire life. if I describe funny way, the relation between user and application will be kind of marriage relation. Hindu marriage. User never leave this platform in their entire life.It will give user great utilization to their entire life. User content, will give us lot of organic traffic which eventually we will turn into profit (certainly, with maintaining user privacy). When we will have million of user we will have infinite option to monetize, infinite option to  make our other application rich through this application.</p>
            <p>
              Sir if you feel, IB need a "life time user engage" application, following things can help you get a good domain. Earlier I wanted to get ibian/ibians.com(very easy to pronounce and easy to remember). Both are selling through broker domain site. So i am not sure about availability. I purchased ibauthor.com. But this is not suitable domain for this purpose. But single syllable domain is good for big app.  The way quora make their domain name
              <ul>
                <li>qu ∈ QUestion</li>
                <li>or ∈ OR</li>
                <li>a ∈ Answer</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>By reading all state above stuff, I believe you did understand all of my idea.  I expect lot of things from my idea. Now its totally up to you. You may think differently about this. Weather you take this idea or not, one thing I am pretty sure a "life time user engage" application will add huge value to IB and we can make glossary like ibian, ibians. A "life time user engage" app can make IB very popular globally with minimal expense. IB brand equity will be huge. we already have connection, community. We will just hold those connection, community for life time reciprocal way. If you don't think to monetize directly from this app you can use this app as company media to make company's other app rich, popular. I believe this app will make IB as global brand, globally popular. I am thinking IB can make their own ecosystem, own community, community for life time. Those community will add value to IB for life time</p>
            <p>Sir ignore my grammar. You know my strength in English</p>
            <p>Good Day Sir <br> Take care sir </p>

            <p>Have you listened to "Thrift Shop" and "can't hold us" by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. These song was listed in "Billboard Hot 100" in 2012. Macklemore friended with Ryan Lewis through mySpace. And mySpace, Friendster came before facebook. They were provide more or less facebook like functionality to their user. So why facebook became so popular? This is because, Harvard students are <b>so cool</b>. So facebook is the community of cool people. So other people start using it. In india IITians are cool, IIMians are cool, BITSian are cool. We have very good connection with some IITians, IIMians, premium university student. Once they start using this platform other people will follow this platform. Initially this app will be community driven. I believe those premium university student will love this app because nobody offered such kind of service before, which will impact on their whole life. They will get life time content in their fingertips. It will organize their study material. It will help them to sharing content with others. It will help them to make a focused community. It will help them to get a very good job. They will love IB. Sir just think about in your case, You had this app when you are class 9. you stored your study material, book summaries, novel gist, movie plot, favorite lyrics, any important event, favorite any stuff, what happening in your surroundings, your daily dairy(we will allow user to make it private) or you wrote some book from class 9 everyday or weekly or fortnightly or monthly. Now you get all content in your fingertips. Everything at once. Can you imagine. You can revise anything anytime. You can connect your all old high school friends. Very odd thing in my case, I forget some school friends name. If you need any reference it will take 15 seconds to get that through timeline(I kept name timeTravel. Because "timeTravel" sounds fancier). You could keep track of anything you want. Suppose now you have very old community, you have your all study material in this platform and everyday it gives you very good utilization. Will you leave this platform at any point? Certainly not. This is the reason people will use this in their entire life once they have started.  Certainly it will help million people Every Single Day.

            <p><strong>P.P.S:</strong> Twitter went public in 2013, it was valued at $24 billion. Which is more than 12 times the New York Times’s market capitalization —even though the Times earned $133 million in 2012 while Twitter lost money. What explains the huge premium for Twitter? The answer is cash flow. This sounds bizarre at first, since the Times was profitable while Twitter wasn’t. <b> But a great business is defined by its ability to generate cash flows in the future</b> <small>-(021)</small>. Here you can see true power of active user. In 2013 twitter had 200 million users. Now they have 328 million active user. Someday  Certainly we will have million user. Million of active  user. Million of quality user. And we will be able to make a IB ecosystem through Monopolistic competition</p>
            <!-- <p><strong>P.P.S:</strong> My brain is pretty dumb. It doesn't function in the same way like other people brain. I generally understand people speech minute or 2 minutes later. Sometime I didn't understand even people joke in just in time. So I have to trick myself in different way to cope up with other people. I customized literally every tool to ease of use. Earlier I used to use a blog to organize my study material. One of the FTFL exam you were furious with me because I helped Sium(FTFL mate) through my blog which was very bad idea. That day Sium was hopeless. However that blog helped me a lot to learn lot of stuff those days. Initially I get this idea from my blog idea. I made this app from user perspective and I strongly believe, this app will help million people including me. And Million people will love IB. Before coming india I never heard this sentence 'Things fall into place'. In medchal office the place I used to sit some one added tag on cabin wall where 'Things fall into place' was written. Then I googled this sentence and understood meaning of it. Whenever I remember this I feel some connection. What I dream about all those things align with IB. </p> -->
           <p><strong>P.P.P.S:</strong> I have seen a award program on YouTube earlier, where Vidya balan stated, Indian people prefer three things. Entertainment, Entertainment and Entertainment. Yes People prefer Entertainment over enlightenment. This is reason you will find out Chetan Bhagat stereo typical novel 2 state, one indian girl sold million copy and some of novel turned into bollywood commercial movie. This is the app for enlightenment and enlightenment is permanent in Human life. So initially we might go with steady phase but it long run we will reign the web. Due to social features enlightenment will become entertainment to user. I strongly believe one day having a account in this platform will be a social status. This is because it will define that person sincerity. Sir million people will enlighten their life through this app. We will connect the whole world very resourceful way. How about this we won't monetize from this app but use its popularity to reach potential audience for our others product or future app. It will increase IB values globally. Sir I believe when we have million of active user we can get expected outcome from our any app/service in very short period of time.</p>
           <p><strong>P.P.P.S:</strong> Kothandaraman Vaitheeswaran founded Indiaplaza.com in 1999. It was the first indian e-commerce. So it suppose to be the No 1 e-commerce site in india. But it failed. They shutdown their website in 2013. What explain this fail? The main reason is they came early. The time indiaplaza launched, People don't know how to use INTERNET, dont know how to do internet shopping , how to do online shopping, how to place an order. So it failed. They failed to adopt market. I believe this is the perfect time to unveil our application based on this idea. Now a days a school student also able to operate Internet. They can post on social media. Most of the people are aware of social media features. But those social media are not adding value to their life. I believe school student will use this application with or without help of their parents and parents will motivate them. We can offer most convenient UX to the user. Another thing is <b>location matter</b> for this application. I believe India is the best place to launched this application. We can expect wide variety of student from all around India. Yahoo Answers, Stack Overflow, quora made based upon same idea but implementation is different, vision is different. They all 3 sites actually very successful. People are using 3 sites for different purpose. I strongly believe our platform will help million people to shape their future. some of social features you may find already exist in other site but If you think about whole app you will find out it will serve with different purpose and vision is different. I believe it will enlighten millions. <strong>Any business model which is community driven, collaborative and peers generally highly successful than general business model.</strong></p>
           <p>Sir I love IB.</p>
           <p>All those stuff you hear from me is self reference criterion. I curated whole thing by thinking long term not tomorrow. I believe I make you understand about whole idea, future of this idea. I strongly believe this "life time user engage" app will give confidence to IB. It will strengthen IB. It will give boldness to LEMONS. It will make IB durable to survive century after century. This app will make IB globally popular. This is because User is king. IB certainly will be million people company and million people will be getting benefit from this idea. Hope you people love this idea. Validate this business Idea to make a IB Eco-system. I am a massive optimist about IB eco-system and there are tons of reasons. Sir just visualize what will be this platform 3~5 years later . I believe you will also be massive optimist like me. I read a Bill Gates quote earlier <blockquote>Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.</blockquote> </p> 
           <p>Sir Any bigger company backed up by bigger vision. I believe this idea will help million people in their everyday life. It will help people, generation after generation. Million people will be grateful on IB. I feel like <b>this is the only available slot in the world  to make a "life time user engaging" app where you can expect massive amounts user.</b></p>
           <p>I read a fictional book The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. Here i found a quote which is very promising  <blockquote>When you want something, all the universe conspires to help you achieve it.</blockquote></p>

              Amazon became fifth-largest company by market value(400 billion). They are doing business in E-commerce(amazon.com), Cloud computing(AWS), streaming service(Prime). No one compete Amazon in these field. All other business giant scare about Amazon business. Wallmart acquired a ecommerce startup Jet.com for $3 billion to compete with amazon.com . Microsoft trying to expand their cloud computing to compete with Amazon AWS.  Netflix CEO Reed Hastings made comments regarding amazon prime streaming service. <blockquote>As Jeff is there, it's a kind of scare.</blockquote> Apple is competing with amazon for streaming content. Google made their own virtual assistant Google Home to compete with Amazon Alexa. But Jeff bezos work with big vision. He shows the world true power of compound interest. I believe soon he will be richest person in the world. Now amazon want to go that place where Amazon-made software-services or tools will help his rival organizations to grow. So what actually scary competitor for amazon? These are Search engine, social media, mass media. In 2013 Jeff Bezos purchased The Washington Post. 
            </p>
            <p>We are connect with more than 100 college and university. I believe we can easily make 500 account from each college. So total account will be 50000. Once they start using this platform it will be kind of trendz. Then we can negotiate with Amazon to acquired our platform. I believe if we good at negotiating, Amazon certainly will buy this platform. Because I believe they need a social platform since they are scared about social platform as their competitor and they purchased Washington Post as mass media. This platform is comes with large vision and generosity in mind to help million of people in their every day life. So they might be interest in our platform. I believe amazon is most suitable company for this social platform since they have their own cloud computing service, Big architecture for bigger app. Data will grow exponentially in our application.</p>
            <p>If you have more robust plan we might not go with any such negotiation.</p>
            <p>I just searched for an opportunity and I found it. In long run we may get lot of business opportunity like this. Might be state above opportunity won't come. Might be we will have better opportunity. I strongly believe when we have lot of active user we will have endless possibility to monetize, make popular other products, building a brand. We might help startup to build their brand through our app.</p>

                Indiaplaza made 1999 by K Vaitheeswaran. It was first indian e commerce. People dont know how to use INTERNET, dont know how to do internet shopping , online shopping, place an order. So it failed. Because they came very early. They failed to adopt.
                now a days people are already accustomed with social media. even a high school kid also know how to use social media. But these social media are not adding value to people life. Yes this the golden time to release such a social media which will add huge value to people life in their life time.
                You can think this is a optional business unit. It won't take much hurdle to release this app for IB. We are not going to rewrite a whole mahabarat. we are not making company like spaceX. and we already doing lot of campaign in different institute, school, college, university, organization. We will do campaign along with other campaign. I believe if we grow in expected phase it could be the main business unit of IB. and It will be million people  company.
